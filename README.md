- 15-100+ civilians "acceptable" per target tier
- Removes human ethical hesitation
- **Result**: Algorithmic warfare at unprecedented scale

**Impact**: October 2024 Gaza operations saw hundreds of strikes per day, thousands of casualties, and demonstrated the transformation of warfare from human-driven to AI-driven decision making.
