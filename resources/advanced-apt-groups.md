Equation Group represents the apex of offensive cyber capabilities, widely attributed to the NSA's elite Tailored Access Operations unit. Their toolset, partially exposed by the Shadow Brokers leak in 2016-2017, demonstrated unprecedented technical sophistication including firmware-level implants, zero-day exploit chains, and advanced persistence mechanisms that survive disk formatting.

#### Key Operations & Malware

**Stuxnet (2009-2010)** - Joint US-Israeli operation targeting Iranian nuclear facilities with 4 zero-days and PLC manipulation causing physical centrifuge destruction.

**ETERNALBLUE** - SMBv1 exploit later weaponized in WannaCry and NotPetya attacks.
