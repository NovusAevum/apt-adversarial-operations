**Note on Repository Dating**:
The repository previously referenced "September 2025" for the 12-day war. Based on multiple reliable sources (Times of Israel, Wikipedia, Atlantic Council), the actual conflict occurred in **June 2025**. The confusion may stem from:
1. October 2024 Israeli-Iranian exchanges
2. September 2024 Hezbollah escalations
3. Ongoing nature of conflicts making precise dating challenging in real-time documentation
