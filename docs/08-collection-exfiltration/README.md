# Phase 8: Collection & Exfiltration

## üéØ Executive Overview

Collection and Exfiltration represent the culmination of APT operations - gathering target intelligence and covertly transmitting it to adversary-controlled infrastructure. This phase transforms access into actionable intelligence, making it the primary objective for espionage-focused operations.

**Strategic Significance**: While ransomware and destructive attacks grab headlines, the most sophisticated state-sponsored operations focus on long-term intelligence collection. The 2024 Israeli Mossad operations extracted terabytes of Iranian nuclear research data over 18 months without detection, demonstrating the art of patient, methodical exfiltration.

**Exfiltration (TA0010)**: 9 techniques for transferring data to adversary control

**Real-World Context**: During the 2023-2024 campaign by Chinese APT groups against telecommunications providers (Salt Typhoon), adversaries collected call metadata, SMS messages, and surveillance data from millions of users over 8+ months, using custom exfiltration protocols that blended with legitimate network traffic.
